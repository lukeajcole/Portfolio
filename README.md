## <ins>Installation</ins>

Before this site can be used, be sure to fill out the .env.EXAMPLE file with your database information. Next, you will need to fill out the Content.JSON and Settings.JSON files in the setup folder. The content and settings you enter here are the easiest and quickest way to customize. 

Be sure to run the following command in a terminal that's opened in the same directory as server.js:
 ```md
 npm install
 ```
Finally, you can run the following code to run the backend and see it in action on your localhost

 ```md
node server.js
 ```

## <ins>Usage</ins>

Since this is just a template, you are free to do whatever you want with it. The idea behind this is that it gets a set of basic portfolio information on the page without having to do any coding. Then, from there you can let your creativity craft the portfolio into something that matches your own business and style.

The template is pre-filled in with my information as an example.

## <ins>Future Improvements</ins>

*Create an admin page that you can use to enter the content and change the settings
*Create an admin view that shows all of the messages that come from the contact form
*Create an event planner that is edittable on the admin page but read only on the client facing page. This will help with any business offerings that require scheduling lots of meetings such as a therapist of masseuse
*Load the JSON files into a MongoDB and tie it to the front end with Mongoose
